# Primitive Data types
Purpose of these exercises is to better understand primitive data types in Typescript.

## Exercise 1

Fill out the table with proper primitive data types, three available options are `string`,`number` or `boolean`.

|Data| Data type |
|-------------|:-------------:|
| `"Hello World"` ||
| `1` ||
| `"2000"` ||
| `-5` ||
| `false` ||
| `"false"` ||
| `true` ||
| `0` ||
| `1 + 2` ||
| `"5" + "6"` ||
| `true + true` ||
| `100 - "50"` ||

## Exercise 2
Provide code example for following:
* Transform `string` to `number`
* Transform `number` to `string`
* Transform `boolean` to `string`
* Transform `string` to `boolean`
* Transform `number` to `boolean`

## Exercise 3
Purpose for this exercise is to understand some `string` methods.

Provide code example for following:
* How many characters there are in `Leeroy Jenkins!`
* Extract words from index `0` to `6` in `Leeroy Jenkins!`
* Replace word `Leeroy` with `Leeeeeeeeeeeeeroy` in `Leeroy Jenkins!`
* Make `Leeroy Jenkins!` in uppercase
* Make `Leeroy Jenkins!` in lowercase
* Concatenate `Leeroy` and `Jenkins`
* Remove whitespace from both sides in `••••Leeroy Jenkins!••••`
* Return second letter in word `Leeroy`
* Check if there is word `Jenkins` in `Leeroy Jenkins!`
* Check if `Leeroy Jenkins!` includes `Jenkins`
* Check if `Leeroy Jenkins!` includes `Dragon`
* On which index does `Jenkins` starts in `Leeroy Jenkins!`
* Create a variable `const name = <your name>` and create a string `My name is <name>` using Template Literals

## Exercise 4
Purpose for this exercise is to understand some `number` methods.

Provide code example for following:
* Sum `10` and `7`
* Divide `20` and `2`
* Subtract `20` and `3`
* Raise `4` in power of `3` 
* Multiply `2` and `5`
* Increment `4` by `1` 
* Get division remainder from `10` and `6` 
* Make `3.1415926` to be fixed with 2 numbers after comma. 
* From `78.643056` show only first number.
