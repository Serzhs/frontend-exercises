# Variables
Purpose of this exercises is to understand variables and difference between `var`, `let` and `const`.

## Exercise 1 - Create and reassign variables

- Create and `console.log()` variable using `const` including your nickname
- Create and `console.log()` variable using `let` including video game you played last 
- Create and `console.log()` variable using `var` including your favorite country
- Create and `console.log()` new `const` variable containing object with information about previously created variables
- Give and `console.log()` a new nickname for you `const` variable and see what happens
- Give and `console.log()` a new value for your `let` variable with first game you ever played
- Create and `console.log()` new `const` variable containing `My nickname is <nickname variable> and first game I ever played was <game-variable>`
- Create and `console.log()` variable using `let` including a number of your choice
- Increment previously created variable value by one and `console.log()` it. 
- Subtract previously created variable value by one and `console.log()` it. 
- Increment previously created variable value by ten and `console.log()` it. 

## Exercise 2 - Scope of a variable
- Create `const`, `let` and `var` variables of your choice and `console.log()` them.
- Create an `if` condition of your choice and create new `const`, `let` and `var` variables of your choice, when you are done `console.log()` variables outside `if` condition.
- Create an `function` of your choice and declare `const`, `let` and `var` variables of your choice when you are done `console.log()` variables outside `function`.
- Inside `function` do `console.log()` variables you created in the first bullet point.

When you are done can you spot a differences between variable declaration types in matter of scope?
